  <h2>Desing</h2>
  <p>I worked for a <a href="https://www.asiha.co.kr/"
    target="_blank" title="Designer Brand">unisex casual brand</a> targeting from my late teens to late 30s, and my duties were design and production detail pages, product registration, event and news pop-up images, and Naver gfa image banner ads and Google Ads banner ads. In charge of this, we have experience in increasing sales by more than three times. Since it was not a well-known brand, I thought that it was the priority to inform customers through image banners, and it seemed to be accepted by customers by trying to melt the feeling of the brand well.</p>
